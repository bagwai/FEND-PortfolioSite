### Project 1 

###Questions: 1. Is it possible to do HTML 5 like tags - <header> <section> with bootstrap style <container> <row> <col-md-x>?
			  
###Comments:
0. index.html is an HTML file, which is a document that will be displayed as a website. 
1. css folder has bootstrap framework and my own style.css 
2. All images are under images folder.

### Feedback: This was not hard but still getting used to with nitty gritty.  There is lot of information in three classes that I went through before attempting this assignment.
	But I should have just jumped to this assignment after first course Intro to HTML and CSS which pretty much walks me through this simple assignment. Responsive web design fundamental and Responsive Images were super interesting courses but not essential to finish this project, hope I can work smarted moving forward. 

### Happy Learning!!
